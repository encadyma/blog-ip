Hey there!

Week 1 was a rather slow start for the project. It’s all about getting the learning (b)log up in time. Meanwhile, there were maintenance tasks for Spartan Connect on Friday and a class-by-class presentation on Tuesday.

Here is the breakdown of each day:

- **Monday (8/21)**: Working on completing the “Hello World” blog post for publishing.
- **Tuesday (8/22)**: Class-by-class assembly: Presenting Spartan Connect. (no work on IP)
- **Wednesday (8/23)**: Finishing up the Hello World post and publishing it onto Github Pages.
- **Thursday (8/24)**: Researching web tools (Gulp, Webpack, Yeoman, GraphQL, etc.).
- **Friday (8/25)**: Weekly reflection and ironing out Spartan Connect bugs + implementing mobile features

Stay tuned for Week 2.
