Hey.

I’m in a bit of a crunch. This week was supposed to be design week for Project 1, but it turns out I haven’t made progress on it. Tuesday and Wednesday were spent on other projects, and Friday was a code refactoring day. I’m not very confident in the progress of Project 1 so far, so I will take time next week to refine its design and market strategy.

In addition, I will need to write two long form articles for this quarter. There is one planned for front end frameworks that is in its outlining stage and another that is yet to be decided. Given that this is halfway through the quarter, I will need to catch up quickly on these pieces.

Eek.

Project 1 Deadline: October 6th. (One week before Quarter 1 ends)

- **Monday (8/21)**: (Labor Day, no work)
- **Tuesday (8/22)**: Learning and working with Webpack on a new side Electron project. Packaging fonts, SASS files, Vue files, etc.
- **Wednesday (8/23)**: Learning the Wordpress CMS and helping set up a blog. (Useful for CMS project).
- **Friday (8/25)**: Refactoring Project 1 code and reconsidering main plans for the project.

I’m hopeful for Week 4. Until then --
