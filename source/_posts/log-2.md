Hi!

This week, I am starting Project 1, which is a bibliography generator. I have many ideas for this project, but Iâ€™m given very little time to accomplish it! With that, I will taking this week to explore my options and set up base so that by next week, I can start the project.

- **Monday (8/21)**: Starting an Ionic Project (Angular 2 mobile framework) + designing boilerplate template for IP projects
- **Tuesday (8/22)**: Creating a new Github organization for IP Projects and coding the web template for upcoming projects
- **Wednesday (8/23)**: Completed the Avedi Biblio Landing Page. starting work on customizing page, eg. styling input, etc.
- **Friday (8/25)**: Picking up from Wednesday, adding topic Search functionality

See you then.
